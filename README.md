### About
It is a simple and clean social media platform where users can post their thoughts and reflections in a book bookmark style. The posts are organized by date and randomly arranged vertically or horizontally on the page. Each post is arranged by the number of characters and a color is randomly assigned to each user.

The inspiration for the project was the feeling of reading books and papers, which can provide tranquility and relaxation. The aim of this social media platform is not solely for information sharing, but a place for reflection and thinking.
